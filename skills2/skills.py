# Write a function that takes an iterable (something you can loop through, ie: string, list, or tuple) and produces a dictionary with all distinct elements as the keys, and the number of each element as the value
def count_unique(some_iterable):
    return {}

# Given two lists, (without using the keyword 'in' or the method 'index') return a list of all common items shared between both lists
def common_items(list1, list2):
    return []

# Given two lists, (without using the keyword 'in' or the method 'index') return a list of all common items shared between both lists. This time, use a dictionary as part of your solution.
def common_items2(list1, list2):
    return []
